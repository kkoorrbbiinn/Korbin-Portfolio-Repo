                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, my name is Korbin Westerfield. I was born in Chesapeake, VA and my journey so far has led me to now living in Arizona away from everything I know and love. The same journey has led to big moments in my life, such as becoming a student at General Assembly. Without the course I am currently taking at GA I'm not sure where I would be. I have tried multiple different careers, for example, I was interested in going to school for architecture because it was something I enjoyed sketching at home. I was also interested in graphic design and studied it for a couple years but I'm hoping GA will lead me to a successful software development job. </p>

                <h1>Outside of Work</h1>
                <p>A few of my hobbies include playing golf, playing video games with friends; one of the games I enjoyed playing was Call of Duty, I was ranked top 0.5 percent in the world, and listening to music; some of the artists I enjoy listening to would be Morgan Wallen, Bailey Zimmerman, and Luke Combs. I also enjoy drawing; some of the things I enjoyed drawing were graffiti, architectural designs, and cartoons, watching movies with my girlfriend, and going bowling; I was a junior olympic bowler for a year. Another hobby I enjoy doing would be tattooing; While I lived in Virginia, I was an apprentice under a good friend named Mike. </p>
